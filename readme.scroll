# Why build this?
To provide every human with their own copy of humanity's most intelligent information.

# What is the World Wide Scroll (WWS)?

The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:
- *Offline.* You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- *Non-toxic.* No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright. The WWS and all content on it is public domain.
- *Intelligent.* Built not on HTML, but from the ground up in a simple, expandable language, designed for both humans and AIs.

- *Trustworthy.* Source code and change history behind every page. Human verified editors.

# Reserve your root name today!
The World Wide Scroll beta is live!

You can now reserve a root name on The Scroll!

When you buy a root name, you get to name and edit a root "folder" in the World Wide Scroll.

A root folder is just a few lines of data about your folder and where the files reside, that is written to the root.scroll file.

Revenue from root name sales go toward the development of The Scroll ecosystem including funds to "WWS Reps" who help onboard and maintain the community.
