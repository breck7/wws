# The World Wide Scroll Readme

A healthy, intelligent, trustworthy successor to the web that works offline.

## Why build this?

To provide every human with their own copy of humanity's most intelligent information.

## What is the World Wide Scroll (WWS)?

[View slideshow](https://breckyunits.com/theScroll.html)

The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:

- **Offline:** You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- **Non-toxic:** No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright. The WWS and all content on it is public domain.
- **Intelligent:** Built not on HTML, but from the ground up in a simple, expandable language, designed for both humans and AIs. [Learn about Scroll](https://scroll.pub)
- **Trustworthy:** Source code and change history behind every page. Human-verified editors.

## Reserve your root name today!

The World Wide Scroll beta is live!

You can now reserve a root name on The Scroll. When you buy a root name, you get to name and edit a root "folder" in the World Wide Scroll. Revenue from root name sales goes toward the development of The Scroll ecosystem, including funds to "WWS Reps" who help onboard and maintain the community.

After purchasing, check out the [Getting Started Guide](gettingStarted.html).
