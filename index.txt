The World Wide Scroll
=====================

Why build this?
===============
To provide every human with their own copy of humanity's best information.

What is the World Wide Scroll (WWS)?
====================================
The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:
- *Intelligent.* Built not on HTML, but from the ground up in a simple, expandable language, designed for both humans and AIs.
 https://scroll.pub
- *Offline.* You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- *Pristine.* No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright.
- *Human first.* Instead of anonymous domains the WWS has folders owned by verified humans.
- *Trustworthy.* Source code and change history behind every page.

Install the WWS client
======================
git clone https://github.com/breck7/wws
cd wws
npm install --omit=dev
npm install --omit=dev -g .
wws list
# Fetch a few sites:
wws fetch scroll breck pldb
wws open

The WWS client currently requires Node.js. More clients coming soon.

Buy a Folder
============
The World Wide Scroll beta is live!

You can now buy a folder in the World Wide Scroll for $100 for 10 years.

Fine Print
==========
- A purchase gives you the rights to choose one unique unclaimed alpha-numeric id in the World Wide Scroll for ten years, renewal rights, and update rights to the metadata for that folder, as defined in this file.
 - At any time you may change your folder name to a different unclaimed alpha-numeric id.
- All updates are subject to approval by the World Wide Scroll reps.
- WWS Folders can only be reserved by individuals.
- The WWS is for high quality, non-anonymous content.
 - You must use your real name and a real email address when buying a folder.
  - This information will be publicly visible in this file (`wws.scroll`).
- Limit 5 folders per person.
 - The WWS discourages name squatting and content not edited by humans.
 - If you maintain high quality folders and hit the limit, you can request a higher limit.
- Changes to your folder information may be communicated to the WWS team via email and/or using future self-service software.

Values
======
Art. Calmness. Courage. Freedom. Fun. Intelligence. Laughter. Love. Science. Truth.

These are the words that guide The World Wide Scroll (WWS).
