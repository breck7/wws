The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:
- *Offline.* You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- *Non-toxic.* No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright. The WWS and all content on it is public domain.
- *Intelligent.* Built not on HTML, but from the ground up in a simple, expandable language, designed for both humans and AIs.

- *Trustworthy.* Source code and change history behind every page. Human verified editors.

A root folder is just a few lines of data about your folder and where the files reside, that is written to the root.scroll file.
