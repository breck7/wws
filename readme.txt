The World Wide Scroll
=====================

Why build this?
===============
To provide every human with their own copy of humanity's most intelligent information.

What is the World Wide Scroll (WWS)?
====================================
The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:
- *Intelligent.* Built not on HTML, but from the ground up in a simple, expandable language, designed for both humans and AIs.
 https://scroll.pub simple, expandable language
- *Offline.* You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- *Pristine.* No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright. The WWS and all content on it is public domain.
- *Human first.* Instead of anonymous domains the WWS has folders owned by verified humans.
- *Trustworthy.* Source code and change history behind every page.

Install the WWS client
======================
git clone https://github.com/breck7/wws
cd wws
npm install --omit=dev
npm install --omit=dev -g .
wws list
# Fetch a few sites:
wws fetch scroll breck pldb
wws open

The WWS client currently requires Node.js. More clients coming soon.

Register a Folder
=================
The World Wide Scroll beta is live!

You can now register a root folder in the World Wide Scroll for $100 for 10 years.

When you register a folder in the WWS, you become that folder's "Editor".

The Editor is the person responsible for updating the metadata about that folder.

Registration funds go toward the development of the Scroll language ecosystem. A portion is also distributed to the "WWS Reps" who help onboard and maintain the community.

After you register your root folder, check out the Getting Started Guide.
