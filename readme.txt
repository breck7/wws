The World Wide Scroll
=====================

Why build this?
===============
To provide every human with their own copy of humanity's most intelligent information.

====================================

The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:
- *Intelligent.* Built not on HTML, but from the ground up in a simple, expandable language, designed for both humans and AIs.
 https://scroll.pub simple, expandable language
- *Offline.* You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- *Pristine.* No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright. The WWS and all content on it is public domain.
- *Human first.* Instead of anonymous domains the WWS has folders owned by verified humans.
- *Trustworthy.* Source code and change history behind every page.

Install the WWS client
======================
git clone https://github.com/breck7/wws
cd wws
npm install --omit=dev
npm install --omit=dev -g .
wws list
# Fetch a few sites:
wws fetch scroll breck pldb
wws open

The WWS client currently requires Node.js. More clients coming soon.

Buy a Scroll Name
=================
The World Wide Scroll beta is live!

You can now buy a Scroll Name in the World Wide Scroll!

When you buy a Scroll Name, you can create a "folder" in the World Wide Scroll.

A folder is just a few lines of metadata about your Scroll Name stored in the root.scroll file.

Revenue from Scroll Name sales go toward the development of the Scroll language ecosystem. A portion is also distributed to the "WWS Reps" who help onboard and maintain the community.

 - At any time you may change your folder name to a different unclaimed alpha-numeric id.
- All updates are subject to approval by the World Wide Scroll reps.
- WWS Folders can only be reserved by individuals.
- The WWS is for high quality, non-anonymous content.
 - You must use your real name and a real email address when registering a folder.
  - This information will be publicly visible in root file (`root.scroll`).
- Limit 5 folders per person.
