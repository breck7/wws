Why build this?

To provide every human with their own copy of humanity's most intelligent information.

====================================

The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:
- *Offline.* You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- *Non-toxic.* No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright. The WWS and all content on it is public domain.
- *Intelligent.* Built not on HTML, but from the ground up in a simple, expandable language, designed for both humans and AIs.

- *Trustworthy.* Source code and change history behind every page. Human verified editors.

Reserve your root name today!
=============================
The World Wide Scroll beta is live!

You can now reserve a root name on The Scroll!

When you buy a root name, you get to name and edit a root "folder" in the World Wide Scroll.

A root folder is just a few lines of data about your folder and where the files reside, that is written to the root.scroll file.

Revenue from root name sales go toward the development of The Scroll ecosystem including funds to "WWS Reps" who help onboard and maintain the community.

Fine Print
==========
- A purchase gives you the rights to control a number of lines in `root.scroll`, including choosing one unique unclaimed alpha-numeric id which is the name of your root folder, as well as rights to update that folder information for ten years and renewal rights.
 - At any time you may change your folder name to a different unclaimed alpha-numeric id.
- All updates are subject to approval by the World Wide Scroll reps.
- WWS Folders can only be reserved by individuals.
- The WWS is for high quality, non-anonymous content.
 - You must use your real name and a real email address when registering a folder.
  - This information will be publicly visible in root file (`root.scroll`).
- Limit 10 folders per person.
 - The WWS discourages name squatting and content not edited by humans.
 - If you maintain high quality folders and hit the limit, you can request a higher limit.
- Changes to your folder information may be made by pull request or communicated to your WWS rep via email.
- Folders must adhere to the Guidelines
